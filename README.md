This repository includes a set of fully documented code examples that
demonstrate best practices and typical usage patterns of the Coaty core
framework functionality.

The examples are substructured by available Coaty language variants, such as
`js` for Coaty JavaScript and `swift` for CoatySwift. Some examples, e.g. "Hello
World" and "Remote Operations" provide interoperable Coaty agents programmed in
different language variants.

## Coaty Templates

This repository also includes a ready-to-use
[**template**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/template/js)
for a Coaty agent running in Node.js and programmed in TypeScript. Copy and use
it as a blueprint for your own Coaty agent projects.

A template for a Coaty Swift agent can be found in the `CoatySwiftExample`
folder of the [CoatySwift](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-swift) repo.
